Election Exit Poll Prediction and U.S.A Presidential Speech Analysis using Machine Learning

## Course: Machine Learning
This project is based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. 
The first project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted.
The second project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. 
One has to draw inferences based on the analysis done on these speeches.

 ## Problem 1:
You are hired by one of the leading news channels CNBE who wants to analyze recent elections. 
This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. 
You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

## Dataset for Problem: 
Election_Data.xlsx

## Problem 2:
In this particular project, we are going to work on the inaugural corpora from the nltk in Python.
We will be looking at the following speeches of the Presidents of the United States of America:
#### President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941
#### President John F. Kennedy in 1961
#### President Richard Nixon in 1973
